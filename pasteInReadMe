# Code of Conduct and License choice

We chose the MIT license and a general Code of Conduct provided by Github. 
We chose the MIT license specifically because it allows people to use our open source software and make derivatives of it. 
The Code of Conduct was chosen becuase it was reccomended by GitHub for large projects. Since our project will be the largest, most succesful project in history, 
this was necessary to keep the development community safe and welcoming.
