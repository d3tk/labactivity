# Readme

This code is written for one purpose. To find out everyone's birthday, then if it is said person's birthday, then they get an email for a free burrito from Chipotle.
They then realize once they get there, they do not get a free burrito and were scammed.
Then their birthday is ruined and they are burrito-less and upset driving home from chipotle.

## How to Contribute
It would be nice if you helped with a problem we are currently having. For some reason everyone that is born in January the program is not correctly working. It would be greatly appreciated if you put your time and effort into solving this issue.


# Code of Conduct and License choice

We chose the MIT license and a general Code of Conduct provided by Github. 
We chose the MIT license specifically because it allows people to use our open source software and make derivatives of it. 
The Code of Conduct was chosen becuase it was reccomended by GitHub for large projects. Since our project will be the largest, most succesful project in history, 
this was necessary to keep the development community safe and welcoming.
